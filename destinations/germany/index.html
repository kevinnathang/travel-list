            <div class="country-description">Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests, rivers, mountain ranges and North Sea beaches. It has over 2 millennia of history. Berlin, its capital, is home to art and nightlife scenes, the Brandenburg Gate and many sites relating to WWII. Munich is known for its Oktoberfest and beer halls, including the 16th-century Hofbr채uhaus. Frankfurt, with its skyscrapers, houses the European Central Bank. German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich H채ndel were influential composers of the Baroque period. As of 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe. German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht D체rer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Gr체newald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance. German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane.</div>

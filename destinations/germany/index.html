            <div class="country-description">Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests, rivers, mountain ranges and North Sea beaches. It has over 2 millennia of history. Berlin, its capital, is home to art and nightlife scenes, the Brandenburg Gate and many sites relating to WWII. Munich is known for its Oktoberfest and beer halls, including the 16th-century Hofbräuhaus. Frankfurt, with its skyscrapers, houses the European Central Bank. German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. As of 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe. German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance. German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane.</div>

            <div class="why-title">Why Germany?</div>
            <div class="why-explain">Germany's multitude of regional identities offers a cornucopia of distinct experiences to meet all kinds of expectations and suit all possible tastes (even the most discriminating ones) - whatever it is you fancy: beautiful scenery, great architecture, lively festivals, glamorous events, exciting nightlife, delicious food and the best beer ever - Germany has it all and more… Everyone (beer aficionados in particular) should, at least once in their lifetime, attend this great festival IMO, and join in the fun of downing consecutive Maßkrüge, to the sounds of lederhosen-clad 'Oompah Bands' while feasting on 'wurst,' 'hendl' and 'schweinebraten,' and generally, celebrating all things Bavarian. The capital city of Bavaria, situated near the foothills of the Alps, with its characteristic ornate architecture, beautiful parks, world-class museums, nearby castles, and its trademark 'beer gardens' is a great place to visit year-round and not just during Oktoberfest. With all its 'wurst' this and 'wurst' that (1500 different types of sausages) served with sauerkraut and potato salad, exquisite soups and stews, 'sauerbraten,' 'schweinebraten,' 'schwenkbraten,' (and other 'bratens'), hundreds of different types of bread (Brötchen my favorite), all washed down with the best beer in the world, Germany is a true gastronomic wonderland.
